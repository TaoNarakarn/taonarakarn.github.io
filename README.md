# What is this?
This is a attemp to create my portfolilo using React and MUI so that I can have cool portfolio like everybody else?
I suck at designing things so lets get better at page designing as we goes along
Project mostly done on local server

## what I wanted to do? (todos)
  - [ ] Connect to backend by using Amazon lambda
  - [ ] Playing with more APIs: JWTs, supertoken
  - [ ] Favicon still need to change, its still create react app default (I don't have any design in mind)
  - [ ] Add more stuff in codebits
  - [x] Performance issue when update array of object state (its input is lag without helping library) : I fix this by create temporary state and merge them back when saved
  - [ ] Design a bunch more stuff (resume builder: template(3 done), style editor, data entry(done))
